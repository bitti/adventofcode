#+TITLE: Advent of Code Solutions in Julia

I'm just a Julia beginner but I try to implement the solutions to http://adventofcode.com
in order to challenge me and to learn some Julia along the way. The problems are not meant
to be most efficient or clear. But I'm at least attempting to be reasonable and idiomatic.
Since I hardly know the Julia idioms I appreciate any feedback from experienced Julia
developers.

Currently the scripts are only tested with Julia 0.3.6. Most of them can be called by
providing the input to stdin:

#+begin_src sh
$ julia day1-part1.jl <input1
#+end_src

Currently the only exception is Day 4 which expects its input as a parameter:

#+begin_src sh
$ julia day4-part2-var1.jl yzbqklnj
#+end_src
